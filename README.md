My project to learn more about iOS Kernel Exploitation.

Using v0rtex (https://github.com/Siguza/v0rtex) as the starting point. The original project gets tfp0, works on A7 through A10 devices on iOS 10.3.3 or lower (offsets not yet included though).

The code contains snippets collected from a wide range of projects. Includes the stuff from older jailbreaks, iOS 11 WIP code,  They all belong to their respective owners.

Completed:
SSH Access
Rootfs remount as r/w
AMFI patches to run unsigned binaries
